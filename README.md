# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the operations of a hospital emergency room (ER) to assess performance metrics and potential improvements. The current system consists of two non-dedicated doctors attending patients, with priority given to those needing immediate attention (NIA). After initial treatment, patients may be discharged or transferred to a hospital ward for post-operative care. The project explores the impact of transitioning to a dedicated doctor system and varying nurse staffing levels on patient and staff metrics.
Key Outcomes:

- Performance Metrics Analysis: Assessing average queue length for NIA and CW patients, total time in the system for both patient types, and utilization of doctors and nurses.
- Scenario Analysis: Evaluating different scenarios with varying combinations of doctor allocation and nurse staffing levels to identify the most effective system configuration.
- Statistical Testing: Conducting statistical tests, including scenario analysis and confidence interval estimation, to compare alternative scenarios and ensure accurate results.

Skills Exhibited:

- Analytical Skills: Analyzing complex systems and performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
- Statistical Analysis: Conducting scenario analysis and statistical tests to compare alternative scenarios and evaluate results.
- Model Building: Constructing simulation models to simulate the operation of the hospital emergency room under different scenarios.
- Data Visualization: Creating time series plots and result managers to visualize performance metrics and model outputs.
- Decision-Making: Providing recommendations based on analysis results to optimize the operation of the hospital emergency room.

Technologies: Simul8 software, Statistical analysis.
